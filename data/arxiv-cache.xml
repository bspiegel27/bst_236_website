    <title>Learning Streaming Video Representation via Multitask Training</title>
    <summary>  Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time
applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video
understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process
video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make
low-latency decisions.To address these challenges, our main contributions are
three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as
StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained
vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while
maintaining image representation capability.(ii) To train StreamFormer, we
propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a
multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns
global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships
simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action
detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering.
StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency,
demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.

    <title>MP-SfM: Monocular Surface Priors for Robust Structure-from-Motion</title>
    <summary>  While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years,
state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint
changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios. Because
capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits
the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these
limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and
normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration
of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms
existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong
performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help
reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem
for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing
challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty
propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred
by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from
future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/cvg/mpsfm.

    <title>AutoJudge: Judge Decoding Without Manual Annotation</title>
    <summary>  We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model
(LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of
matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify
which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated
response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be
generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test
which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to
preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight
classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time,
which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final
answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B
(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more
accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer
accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss
in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach
automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows
similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

    <title>LIRM: Large Inverse Rendering Model for Progressive Reconstruction of
  Shape, Materials and View-dependent Radiance Fields</title>
    <summary>  We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture
that jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields
with view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the
recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art
sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to
reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or
generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics
engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical
contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.
First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more
input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane
neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and
material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding
mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and
material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model
achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based
dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting
accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.

    <title>Socially-Aware Autonomous Driving: Inferring Yielding Intentions for
  Safer Interactions</title>
    <summary>  Since the emergence of autonomous driving technology, it has advanced rapidly
over the past decade. It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous
vehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the
roads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant
challenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting
with surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of
surrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change
decision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors
but also predicting their future motions without any direct communication.
However, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of
surrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a
social intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
coupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework
can be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated
environment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach
enhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on
roads.

    <title>HJRNO: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability with Neural Operators</title>
    <summary>  Ensuring the safety of autonomous systems under uncertainty is a critical
challenge. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) analysis is a widely used method
for guaranteeing safety under worst-case disturbances. Traditional HJR methods
provide safety guarantees but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, limiting
their scalability to high-dimensional systems or varying environmental
conditions. In this work, we propose HJRNO, a neural operator-based framework
for solving backward reachable tubes (BRTs) efficiently and accurately. By
leveraging the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), HJRNO learns a mapping between
value functions, enabling fast inference with strong generalization across
different obstacle shapes, system configurations, and hyperparameters. We
demonstrate that HJRNO achieves low error on random obstacle scenarios and
generalizes effectively across varying system dynamics. These results suggest
that HJRNO offers a promising foundation model approach for scalable, real-time
safety analysis in autonomous systems.

    <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only
  measurements with symbolic regression</title>
    <summary>  Binary neutron star inspirals detected as gravitational waves carry
information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii,
which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. An
expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data
would be advantageous for the multi-messenger astronomy. Using pySR, a symbolic
regression method trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input,
an approximate symbolic expression for neutron-star radius as a function of
mass and tidal deformability is obtained. The approximation is tested on
piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on various
non-polytropic EOSs based on realistic theories of dense matter, achieving
consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the approximation for
a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations,
with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the
approximation is applied to GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal
deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius
distributions.

    <title>Probabilistic and Causal Satisfiability: Constraining the Model</title>
    <summary>  We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and
causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains,
the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events
$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic
terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication
(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a
joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of
(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and
linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean
satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,
it is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with
interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of
languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity
remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a
marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in
complexity.
  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by
constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying
structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and
give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.
Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable
instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with
compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability
under small-model constraints across different settings.

    <title>Collaborative Inference for Sparse High-Dimensional Models with
  Non-Shared Data</title>
    <summary>  In modern data analysis, statistical efficiency improvement is expected via
effective collaboration among multiple data holders with non-shared data. In
this article, we propose a collaborative score-type test (CST) for testing
linear hypotheses, which accommodates potentially high-dimensional nuisance
parameters and a diverging number of constraints and target parameters. Through
a careful decomposition of the Kiefer-Bahadur representation for the
traditional score statistic, we identify and approximate the key components
using aggregated local gradient information from each data source. In addition,
we employ a two-stage partial penalization strategy to shrink the approximation
error and mitigate the bias from the high-dimensional nuisance parameters.
Unlike existing methods, the CST procedure involves constrained optimization
under non-shared and high-dimensional data settings, which requires novel
theoretical developments. We derive the limiting distributions for the CST
statistic under the null hypothesis and the local alternatives. Besides, the
CST exhibits an oracle property and achieves the global statistical efficiency.
Moreover, it relaxes the stringent restrictions on the number of data sources
required in the current literature. Extensive numerical studies and a real
example demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our proposed method.

    <title>exoALMA V: Gaseous Emission Surfaces and Temperature Structures</title>
    <summary>  Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about
their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic
properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within
the disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line
profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the
emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO
$J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$. We find that $^{12}$CO traces the upper disk
atmosphere, with mean &lt;$z/r$&gt; values of $\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$CO and CS
trace lower regions of the disk with mean &lt;z/r&gt; values of $\approx$ 0.16 and
$\approx$ 0.18, respectively. We find that $^{12}$CO &lt;$z/r$&gt; and the disk mass
are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a
straightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature
distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the
surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized
substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly
every disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular
tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display
evidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common
even in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical
and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for,
highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the
role of projection effects on our observations.
